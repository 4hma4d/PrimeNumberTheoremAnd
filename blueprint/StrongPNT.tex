\begin{definition}
The Chebyshev Psi function is defined as
$$
\psi(x) = \sum_{n \leq x} \Lambda(n),
$$
where $\Lambda(n)$ is the von Mangoldt function.
\end{definition}




Main Theorem: The Prime Number Theorem in strong form.
\begin{theorem}[PrimeNumberTheorem]
There is a constant $c > 0$ such that
$$
Ïˆ (x) = x + O(x e^{-c \sqrt{\log x}})
$$
as $x\to \infty$.
\end{theorem}
